In this course, we will be exploring ways that technology can be used to interpret data and facts into visual or audio interactive experiences.

We will begin by taking a look at different examples of digital activism and how creatives have merged data and facts with visual and
audio experiences.


A few data art/visualization examples include graphics I built using p5.js:


Using P5.js
<a href="https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/full/SkTqyCA-X">Weed Disparity</a>
<a href="https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/full/HJS8yC0WQ">Pedestrian ticketing</a>
<a href="https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/full/SkARkAA-Q">Jacksonville, FL Pedestrian</a>
 
 
After spending time exploring different data art creations, we'll explore different datasets that we could possibly use in our own
creations.

Some datasets include:
 
 Datasets:

<a href="http://www.planecrashinfo.com/database.htm">Plane Crash Info</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States">List of The Presidents</a>
<a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/">The Sentencing Project</a>
<a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/">Social Science in The Public Interest Database</a>
<a href="https://www.bjs.gov/">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a>





We'll then be quickly introduced to p5.js and ways we can quickly build visualizations within it.

We'll spend time building our own data art and then use the last portion of class to share our work.
